A structured report of my Induction Program at GNDEC using Markdown.

## Introduction
This report provides a summary of my experience during the induction program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC). The program was designed to help us transition smoothly into college life, understand the academic and cultural environment, and interact with peers and faculty. Each day offered new insights, engaging sessions, and activities that allowed us to explore the values, expectations, and opportunities the college offers.

## Day 1

### 8:30 AM – 10:00 AM: Spiritual Start

Our first day as freshers began with a peaceful visit to the college Gurudwara Sahib. We offered prayers to seek blessings for our journey ahead. It was a calm and respectful start to our college life.

### 10-00 AM - 10:45 AM: Refreshments

After the prayer session, we were provided with snacks and refreshments by the college. This gave us an opportunity to relax and interact with fellow students.

### 11:00 AM onwards: Official Induction Begins

We assembled in the auditorium where the induction program officially began.

#### Session 4: Talk by Prof. Harpreet Kaur – Head of Applied Sciences

Prof. Harpreet Kaur, the Head of the Applied Science Department — which all first-year students are part of — addressed us with an inspiring talk.

- She emphasized the importance of **independent thinking** as we transition from school to college life.
- She described the **Applied Science Department** as a crucial bridge that helps students adapt to the college environment, both academically and mentally.
- One of her key messages was that **our placements are in our own hands**, and it is our consistent effort that shapes our future.
- She introduced us to the concept of the **5 P's** that lead to growth:
  - **Passion**
